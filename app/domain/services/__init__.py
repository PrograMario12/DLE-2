"""
The services folder located at app/domain/services contains the classes
and functions that implement the business logic of the application.
Here, the services responsible for interacting with data models,
performing validations, processing information, and acting as
intermediaries between the routes (endpoints) and the database are
defined.
Its purpose is to keep the business logic separate from the rest of the
application, making the code easier to maintain, reuse, and test.
